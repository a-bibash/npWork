# Simple TCP/IP Server

This is a simple TCP/IP server program written in C. It listens for incoming connections from clients, reads messages sent by clients, and sends responses back to clients.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C compiler. For example:
2. Run the compiled executable, providing the port number as a command-line argument. 
3. The server will start listening for incoming connections on the specified port.
4. Connect to the server using a TCP/IP client. You can use tools like Telnet or write your own client program.
5. Once connected, you can send messages to the server. The server will display the received messages and prompt you to enter a response.
6. Enter a response, and the server will send it back to the client.
7. You can continue exchanging messages with the server until you close the connection.
